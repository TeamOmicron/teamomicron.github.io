Omicam handles the complex process of detecting the ball and goals, determining the robot\u2019s position on the field as well as encoding/transmitting this information, all in one highly optimised codebase. The application is developed mostly in C, with some C++ code to interface with OpenCV. It runs on the LattePanda Delta 432 single board computer and uses Linux (Xubuntu 18.04) as its OS. We are proud to report that Omicam is a significant improvement compared to previous vision applications in use at BBC Robotics, as explained in the \u201cPerformance and results\u201d section. Background and previous methods Intelligent, accurate and fast computer vision continues to become increasingly important in RoboCup Jr Open Soccer. With the introduction of the orange ball and advanced teams\u2019 application of \u201cball-hiding\u201d strategies, high resolution yet performant computer vision is now one of the most important elements of a successful RoboCup Jr Open robot. However, detecting the field objects (ball, goals, etc) is now only the bare minimum. Advanced teams also need to accurately estimate their position on the field (localise) in order to execute advanced strategies and gain the upper hand in the competition. Previously, our team used an OpenMV H7 to provide vision. This is a module which uses an STM32 MCU combined combined with an OmniVision camera module to provide low-resolution vision in an easy-to-use MicroPython environment. However, although this approach is functional, its resolution and framerate are extremely limiting for our use case. Hence, we decided the best solution was to do what the most advanced teams were doing, and develop a custom vision application running on a single board computer (SBC). In terms of localisation, in the past we managed to get away with not using any, or using a low-fidelity approach based on detecting the goals in the image. With the introduction of strategies this year, however, team members needed more accurate position data, which requires more complex localisation. Performance and results TODO provide some more empiric data (tables and stuff) here. Maybe also provide a Pitfalls section at the end. Omicam is capable of detecting the ball, goals and lines at 60-70fps at 720p (1280x720) resolution. Compared to the previous OpenMV H7, this is 23x higher resolution at 3x the framerate. 1 In addition, using the novel vision-based localisation algorithm we developed this year, we can now determine the robot\u2019s position to around 1.5cm accuracy at roughly 30 Hz. This is over 5x/25x more accurate 2 than any previous methods used at BBC Robotics, and has been shown to be much more reliable and stable. Using the e-con Systems Hyperyon camera based around the ultra low-light performance IMX290 sensor, Omicam is robust against lighting conditions ranging from near pitch darkness to direct LED light. 1 previous results based on mediocre lighting conditions running well optimised OpenMV H7 code at QVGA resolution. 2 depending on whether LRF based/goal based localisation was used. Field object detection One of the responsibilities of Omicam is to detect the bounding box and centroid of field objects: the ball, goals and also lines. This is accomplished by using the open-source computer vision library OpenCV (v4.2.0). We use a Gstreamer pipeline to decode the camera\u2019s MJPEG stream at our target resolution of 1280x720 pixels, which is read in through an OpenCV VideoCapture object. Pre-processing With the camera frame in OpenCV memory, we then apply the following pre-processing steps to the image: Crop the frame to only leave a rectangle around the mirror visible Flip the image, if necessary, to account for the mounting of the camera on the robot Apply a circular mask to the image to mask out any pixels that aren\u2019t exactly on the mirror Downscale the frame for use when processing the blue and yellow goals, since we don\u2019t need much accuracy on them and they\u2019re large. (only for the field lines) Mask out the robot from the centre of the mirror (as it has reflective plastic on it which comes up as white) Thresholding and component labelling After pre-processing, we then use OpenCV\u2019s parallel_for and inRange functions to threshold three objects at once using three threads (ideally one free core is left for the localisation). This produces a 1-bit binary mask of the image, where each pixel is 255 (true) if it\u2019s inside the RGB range specified, and 0 (false) if it\u2019s not. For the lines, the vision processing step is finished here as we only need a binary mask. Unfortunately, the localisation process can\u2019t begin until the goals have finished processing due to the localiser relying on the goals in its initial estimate calculations (see below). Finally, we use OpenCV\u2019s Grana 1 parallel connected component labeller to detect regions of the same colour in the image. The largest connected region will be the field object we are looking for. OpenCV automatically calculates the bounding box and centroid for each of these connected regions. Coordinate transforms and dispatch Considering the centroid for each field object as a Cartesian vector in pixels coordinates, we convert this vector to polar form and run the magnitude through our mirror dewarping function (see below) to convert it to a length in centimetres. This leaves us with a polar vector for each field object relative to the robot\u2019s centre. We then convert back to Cartesian and use the last localiser position to infer the field object\u2019s absolute position in centimetres. Finally, for the goals we also calculate the relative Cartesian coordinates (convert polar to Cartesian but don\u2019t add localiser position) for use in the localiser\u2019s initial estimate calculations. This information is encoded into a Protobuf format with nanopb, and is sent over UART to the ESP32 using POSIX termios at 115200 baud. Unfortunately, the UART bus is owned by an ATMega 32U4, so a sketch on that device forwards it to the ESP32. TODO images and/or video of thresholded field TODO more detail on dewarp function here (maybe move stuff up from localisation section) Localisation Previous methods and background Localisation is the problem of detecting where the robot is on the field. This information is essential to know in order to develop advanced strategies and precise movement control, instead of just driving directly towards the ball. Currently, teams use three main methods of localisation. Firstly, the most common approach uses the detected goal blobs in the camera to triangulate the robot\u2019s position. This approach can be very inaccurate because of the low resolution of most cameras (such as the OpenMV), the fact that there are only two goals to work with as well as the fact that sometimes the goals are not visible (especially in SuperTeam). Using this approach on an OpenMV, we found accuracy of about 15 cm, but running on Omicam at 720p we found accuracy of around 4-6 cm. The second approach in use is based on distance sensors such laser range finders (LRFs) or ultrasonic sensors. By using a few of these sensors on a robot, the position of the robot can be inferred with trigonometry by measuring the distance to the walls. The drawback of this approach is that it\u2019s impossible to reliably distinguish between interfering objects, such as a hand or another robot, compared to a wall. This means that although this approach can be accurate on an empty field, it is very difficult to use reliably in actual games. On an empty field, teams have found accuracies of 5-10 cm, but data is often invalid and can\u2019t be used reliably in real games. The third approach in use by some teams is one based on 360 degree LiDARS. This approach, being similar to the second approach, has similar accuracy and drawbacks. One additional drawback is the expensive cost and heavy weight of LiDARS. Another approach that can be used is summing displacement values from a mouse sensor, or integrating acceleration data from an IMU. While these approaches have high levels of accuracy initially, the repeated integration of the data gradually builds error over time, and if the robot is on for a particularly long time, the localised position may be several centimetres inaccurate by the end. In addition, these approaches all return relative displacement to the initial position, not an absolute position on the field - meaning a method for calculating the robot\u2019s initial position accurately is still required. Some teams, including us in the past, do not localise at all. Strictly speaking, with many gameplay behaviours, knowing the robot\u2019s position is not necessary. However, with our advanced strategies, localisation is a necessity. Our approach This year, Team Omicron presents a novel approach to robot localisation based on a hybrid sensor-fusion/non-linear optimisation algorithm. Our approach builds an initial estimate of the robot\u2019s position using faster, more inaccurate methods like goal triangulation and mouse sensor displacement. It then refines this estimate to a much higher accuracy by solving a 2D non-linear optimisation problem in realtime. The addition of the optimisation stage to the algorithm increases accuracy by about 4.6x, to be as little as 1.5cm error. Our optimisation algorithm works by comparing observed field line geometry from the camera (sampled via raycasting), to a known model of the field. By trying to optimise the robot\u2019s unknown (x,y) position such that it minimises the error between the observed lines and expected lines at each position, we can infer the robot\u2019s coordinates to a very high level of accuracy. The optimisation stage of our sensor fusion algorithm is based on a paper by Lauer, Lange and Redmiller (2006) 2 , as covered in the paper by Lu, Li, Hu and Zheng (2013) 3 . However, our approaches are different in certain areas, with us making some concessions and improvements to better suit the RoboCup Junior league (as the paper was written for middle-size league). Lauer et al\u2019s approach casts rays and marks points where these rays intersect the lines, whereas we work with these rays and their lengths directly. Their approach also calculates the orientation of the robot, while we trust the value of the IMU for orientation to simplify our algorithm. Their optimisation stage uses the RPROP algorithm to minimise error, while we use Subplex (based on the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm). Finally, Lauer et al\u2019s approach has more complex global localisation and smoothing that can handle unstable localisations with multiple local minima, while our approach assumes only one minimum is present in the objective function. Our approach has the following 4 main steps: Estimate calculation Image analysis Camera normalisation Coordinate optimisation and interpolation Estimate calculation The localiser first constructs an initial estimate of the robot\u2019s position using faster but more inaccurate methods. The preferred method is to sum the displacement data from our PWM3360 mouse sensor to determine our current position since last localisation. However, in certain cases such as the initial localisation after the robot is powered on, we also use the blue and yellow goals to triangulate our position since there\u2019s no initial position for the mouse sensor to use. Once we have an initial localisation though, we can go back to using the mouse sensor data. Figure 1: method for triangulating position using goals coordinates and vectors Once the initial estimate is calculated, which is usually accurate to about 6-10cm, we constrain the optimiser\u2019s bounds to a certain sized rectangle around the centre of the estimated position. We also change the optimiser\u2019s initial estimate position to the estimated position, and scale down its step size significantly. We assume that the estimate is close to the actual position, so a smaller step size means that it won\u2019t overshoot the minimum and will hopefully converge faster. The combination of the estimate bounds with changing localiser settings means that we can often stably converge on the real position of the robot with around 40 objective function evaluations. If the localiser isn\u2019t constrained to the initial estimate bounds, especially on the internationals field we found it could be very unstable and would often get stuck in nonsensical positions like the corners of the field or inside the goals. Constraining the optimiser to the estimate bounds is very helpful to reduce these problems. Image analysis The localiser\u2019s input is a 1-bit mask of pixels that are determined to be on field lines. This is determined by thresholding for the colour white, which is handled by the vision pipeline described earlier. With the input provided, a certain number of rays (usually 64) are emitted from the centre of the line image. A ray terminates when it touches a line, reaches the edge of the image or reaches the edge of the mirror (as it would be a waste of time to check outside the mirror). Currently we use simple trigonometry to project this ray, although we could use the Bresenham line algorithm for more performance. Rays are stored as only a length in a regular C array, as we can infer the angle between each ray as: 2pi / n_rays This step can be summarised as essentially \u201csampling\u201d the line around us on the field. Figure 2: example of ray casting on field, with a position near to the centre Camera normalisation These rays are then dewarped to counter the distortion of the 360 degree mirror. The equation to do so is determined by measuring the pixels between points along evenly spaced tape placed on the real field, via Omicontrol. Using regression software such as Excel or Desmos, an equation can then be calculated to map pixel distances to real distances. In our case, we simply apply the dewarp function to each ray length instead, leaving us with each ray essentially in field coordinates (or field lengths) rather than camera coordinates. This dewarping equation is also used by the vision pipeline to determine the distance to the ball and goals in centimetres. Figure 3: example of applying the dewarp function to an entire image, on the low resolution OpenMV H7. TODO update to new images on the above The second phase of the camera normalisation is to rotate the rays relative to the robot\u2019s heading, using a rotation matrix. The robot\u2019s heading value, which is relative to when it was powered on, is transmitted by the ESP32 (again using Protocol Buffers). For information about how this value is calculated using the IMU, see the ESP32 and movement code page. Coordinate optimisation and interpolation The coordinate optimisation stage is achieved by using the Subplex local derivative-free non-linear optimisation algorithm 4 , re-implemented as part of the NLopt package 5 . This algorithm essentially acts as an efficiency and stability improvement over the well-known Nelder-Mead Simplex algorithm. Talk more about numerical optimisation here? compared to solving Our problem description is as follows: ( TODO not correct ) The most important part of this process is the objective function , which is a function that takes an N-dimensional vector (in our case, an estimated 2D position) and calculates essentially a \u201cscore\u201d of how accurate the value is. This objective function must be highly optimised as it could be evaluated hundreds of times by the optimisation algorithm. Figure 4: map of objective function for a robot placed at the centre of the field. White pixels indicate high accuracy areas and black pixels indicate less accurate areas. This takes up to 30 seconds to calculate for all 44,226 positions. Figure 5: if we treat the value of the objective function as a heightmap, we can also generate a 3D visualisation of it The known geometry of the RoboCup field is encoded into a \u201cfield file\u201d. This is a binary Protcol Buffer file that encodes the geometry of any RoboCup field (including SuperTeam) by dividing it into a grid, where each cell is true if on a line, otherwise false. Increasing the resolution of the grid will increase its accuracy, but also increase its file size. We use a 1cm grid, which stores 44,226 cells and is 42 KiB on disk. This takes about 2 seconds to generate on a fast desktop computer, and is copied across to the LattePanda SBC. The field file is generated by a Python script which can be easily modified to support an arbitrary number of different field layouts, such as SuperTeam or our regional Australian field. Figure 6: visualisation of the field data component of the field file. In the original 243x182 image, 1 pixel = 1cm Although a derivative-based algorithm may be more efficient at solving the problem, we could not determine a way to calculate the derivative of the objective function in a way that was easier than just using a derivative-free algorithm. Especially considering the low dimensionality of the problem, a derivative-based algorithm wasn\u2019t really required. With the robot\u2019s position now determined to the highest accuracy possible, the final step in the localisation process is to smooth and interpolate this coordinate. The optimisation algorithm can produce unstable results, especially in environments where the line is not very visible or mistaken for other objects on the field. Smoothing is currently accomplished by using a simple moving average. A moving median was also tried but led to more unstable results. In future, we would like to investigate more complex digital signal processing such as a low-pass filter or Kalman filter to improve our accuracy. TODO cover dynamic size of moving mean when it\u2019s added Limitations and refinements Although a lot of effort has been spent improving the performance of our approach, some issues with it remain: Accuracy can still be improved. Although 1.5cm is good, it\u2019s still a margin of error that may make some more precise movements difficult. The algorithm can be unstable, especially on internationals fields where lines are harder to see. The initial estimate stage and optimiser bounds helps to correct this, but a better algorithm for detecting lines (perhaps using a Sobel filter) should be looked into. On a related note, the optimiser probably needs too many lines visible to generate a stable position. In fact, this limitation is what led us to develop the hybrid sensor-fusion/optimisation algorithm instead of just optimising directly. In the real world, just optimising was too unstable when lines weren\u2019t visible, compared to idealistic simulation renders. The optimisation stage is still slow, even with only 40 or so objective function evaluations. In the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm (which Subplex is based on), the evaluation of the simplex\u2019s vertices could be multi-threaded to speed it up if more CPU cores were available. May also be possible to run this algorithm on the GPU, if we had one. The algorithm is difficult to debug. Despite programming tools for Omicontrol, it\u2019s still difficult to determine exactly why the algorithm won\u2019t localise sometimes, which could be a problem at competitions. Although this is expected from a complex approach, more debugging tools should be programmed to assist with this. To generate a better final position, a low pass filter or even Kalman filter could be used instead of a simple moving average. Extra/miscellaneous features Interfacing with Omicontrol To interface with our remote management application Omicontrol, Omicam starts a TCP server on port 42708. This server sends Protocol Buffer packets containing JPEG encoded frames, zlib compressed threshold data as well as other information such as the temperature of the SBC. The TCP listen thread receives messages from the Omicontrol client, decodes them and executes the specified action ID (for example, save data to disk) if one is specified. The TCP send thread receives data from the vision and localisation pipelines, and encodes them an sends them over network. We use the SIMD optimised libjpeg-turbo to efficiently encode JPEG frames, so as to not waste performance on the remote debugger (which is disabled during competition). Instead of compressing threshold frames with JPEG, because they are 1-bit images, it was determined that zlib could compress them more efficiently (around about 460,800x reduction in size compared to uncompressed data). With all these optimisations, even at high framerates (60+ packets per second), the remote debug system uses no more than 1 MB/s of outgoing bandwidth, which is small enough to work reliably over both Ethernet and WiFi. Configuration Usually, we embed configuration in a \u201cdefines.h\u201d file. Config includes information like the bounding box of the crop rectangle, the radius of the mirror and the dewarp function. Because this is embedded in a header, the project would have to be recompiled and relaunched every time a setting is updated which is not ideal. For Omicam, we used an INI file stored on the SBC\u2019s disk that is parsed and loaded on every startup. In addition, the config file can also be dynamically reloaded by an Omicontrol action, making even relaunching Omicam un-necessary. Because of this, we have much more flexibility and faster prototyping abilities when tuning to different venues. Video recording and match replay Omicam can record its vision output to disk as an mp4 file. When this is enabled in the configuration, a thread is started that writes video frames to an OpenCV VideoWriter at the correct framerate to produce a stable 60 fps video. These generated videos can be loaded as Omicam input (instead of using a live camera), thus enabling a capture and replay system. In this way, games can be recorded for later analysis of Omicam\u2019s performance and accuracy, or for entertainment value. TODO describe in more depth the new replay system Code optimisation methods Here are a sample of some of th techniques we used, both in code and with the Clang compiler, to optimise Omicam\u2019s performance: Use -O3 optimisation setting in release builds (NOT DONE YET) Use link time optimisation (LTO) with Clang (NOT DONE YET) Use profile guided optimisation (PGO) with Clang Extensive use of multi-threading, especially with OpenCV, to process multiple objects at once. The localisation and vision pipelines are also independent of each other as much as is possible. Enable OpenCV\u2019s CPU-specific optimisations for x86 architecture, such as SSE and AVX instructions Downscale the goal threshold image before processing as less accuracy is required In the localiser, we use the last extrapolated position from the mouse sensor as a seed for the initial position of the next search. This means instead of starting from a random position, the localiser will complete much quickly as it\u2019s already relatively close to the true position. Also cover Linux CPU optimisation and associated thermal issues if relevant Debugging and diagnostics TODO we may use gcc not clang so talk about that too Low-level compiled languages such as C and C++ can be difficult to debug when memory corruption or undefined behaviour issues manifest. In addition, many latent bugs can go undetected in code written in these languages. In order to improve the stability of Omicam and fix bugs, we used Google\u2019s Address Sanitizer (ASan) and Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer (UBSan) to easily find and trace a variety of bugs such as buffer overflows, memory leaks and more. In addition, we used the LLVM toolchain\u2019s debugger lldb (or just gdb) to analyse the application frequently. To assist in performance evaluation, we used the Linux tool OProfile to determine the slowest method calls in the application. Although the Clang compiler may have marginally worse performance than GCC, we chose Clang because it\u2019s more modern and has better debugging support (namely, GCC\u2019s Adress Sanitizer implementation is broken for us). Conclusion This year, Team Omicron presents a high-performance, custom vision and localisation application called Omicam. It is written mainly in C, and runs on a LattePanda Delta 432. It is capable of processing vision at orders of magnitude faster than our previous solution, the OpenMV H7. We also present a novel approach to robot localisation, based on sensor-fusion and 2D non-linear optimisation. This approach is significantly more accurate and robust than previous methods. Finally, we introduce support for communication to our visualisation and managemetn application, Omicontrol (covered separately) using Protocol Buffers. References C. Grana, D. Borghesani, and R.

However, detecting the field objects (ball, goals, etc) is now only the bare minimum. Advanced teams also need to accurately estimate their position on the field (localise) in order to execute advanced strategies and gain the upper hand in the competition. Previously, our team used an OpenMV H7 to provide vision. This is a module which uses an STM32 MCU combined combined with an OmniVision camera module to provide low-resolution vision in an easy-to-use MicroPython environment. However, although this approach is functional, its resolution and framerate are extremely limiting for our use case. Hence, we decided the best solution was to do what the most advanced teams were doing, and develop a custom vision application running on a single board computer (SBC). In terms of localisation, in the past we managed to get away with not using any, or using a low-fidelity approach based on detecting the goals in the image.

This information is essential to know in order to develop advanced strategies and precise movement control, instead of just driving directly towards the ball. Currently, teams use three main methods of localisation. Firstly, the most common approach uses the detected goal blobs in the camera to triangulate the robot\u2019s position. This approach can be very inaccurate because of the low resolution of most cameras (such as the OpenMV), the fact that there are only two goals to work with as well as the fact that sometimes the goals are not visible (especially in SuperTeam). Using this approach on an OpenMV, we found accuracy of about 15 cm, but running on Omicam at 720p we found accuracy of around 4-6 cm. The second approach in use is based on distance sensors such laser range finders (LRFs) or ultrasonic sensors. By using a few of these sensors on a robot, the position of the robot can be inferred with trigonometry by measuring the distance to the walls. The drawback of this approach is that it\u2019s impossible to reliably distinguish between interfering objects, such as a hand or another robot, compared to a wall. This means that although this approach can be accurate on an empty field, it is very difficult to use reliably in actual games. On an empty field, teams have found accuracies of 5-10 cm, but data is often invalid and can\u2019t be used reliably in real games. The third approach in use by some teams is one based on 360 degree LiDARS. This approach, being similar to the second approach, has similar accuracy and drawbacks. One additional drawback is the expensive cost and heavy weight of LiDARS. Another approach that can be used is summing displacement values from a mouse sensor, or integrating acceleration data from an IMU. While these approaches have high levels of accuracy initially, the repeated integration of the data gradually builds error over time, and if the robot is on for a particularly long time, the localised position may be several centimetres inaccurate by the end. In addition, these approaches all return relative displacement to the initial position, not an absolute position on the field - meaning a method for calculating the robot\u2019s initial position accurately is still required. Some teams, including us in the past, do not localise at all. Strictly speaking, with many gameplay behaviours, knowing the robot\u2019s position is not necessary. However, with our advanced strategies, localisation is a necessity.","title":"Previous methods and background"},{"location":"omicam/#our-approach","text":"This year, Team Omicron presents a novel approach to robot localisation based on a hybrid sensor-fusion/non-linear optimisation algorithm. Our approach builds an initial estimate of the robot\u2019s position using faster, more inaccurate methods like goal triangulation and mouse sensor displacement. It then refines this estimate to a much higher accuracy by solving a 2D non-linear optimisation problem in realtime. The addition of the optimisation stage to the algorithm increases accuracy by about 4.6x, to be as little as 1.5cm error. Our optimisation algorithm works by comparing observed field line geometry from the camera (sampled via raycasting), to a known model of the field. By trying to optimise the robot\u2019s unknown (x,y) position such that it minimises the error between the observed lines and expected lines at each position, we can infer the robot\u2019s coordinates to a very high level of accuracy. The optimisation stage of our sensor fusion algorithm is based on a paper by Lauer, Lange and Redmiller (2006) 2 , as covered in the paper by Lu, Li, Hu and Zheng (2013) 3 . However, our approaches are different in certain areas, with us making some concessions and improvements to better suit the RoboCup Junior league (as the paper was written for middle-size league). Lauer et al\u2019s approach casts rays and marks points where these rays intersect the lines, whereas we work with these rays and their lengths directly. Their approach also calculates the orientation of the robot, while we trust the value of the IMU for orientation to simplify our algorithm. Their optimisation stage uses the RPROP algorithm to minimise error, while we use Subplex (based on the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm). Finally, Lauer et al\u2019s approach has more complex global localisation and smoothing that can handle unstable localisations with multiple local minima, while our approach assumes only one minimum is present in the objective function.

The preferred method is to sum the displacement data from our PWM3360 mouse sensor to determine our current position since last localisation. However, in certain cases such as the initial localisation after the robot is powered on, we also use the blue and yellow goals to triangulate our position since there\u2019s no initial position for the mouse sensor to use. Once we have an initial localisation though, we can go back to using the mouse sensor data. Figure 1: method for triangulating position using goals coordinates and vectors Once the initial estimate is calculated, which is usually accurate to about 6-10cm, we constrain the optimiser\u2019s bounds to a certain sized rectangle around the centre of the estimated position. We also change the optimiser\u2019s initial estimate position to the estimated position, and scale down its step size significantly. We assume that the estimate is close to the actual position, so a smaller step size means that it won\u2019t overshoot the minimum and will hopefully converge faster. The combination of the estimate bounds with changing localiser settings means that we can often stably converge on the real position of the robot with around 40 objective function evaluations. If the localiser isn\u2019t constrained to the initial estimate bounds, especially on the internationals field we found it could be very unstable and would often get stuck in nonsensical positions like the corners of the field or inside the goals. Constraining the optimiser to the estimate bounds is very helpful to reduce these problems.","title":"Estimate calculation"},{"location":"omicam/#image-analysis","text":"The localiser\u2019s input is a 1-bit mask of pixels that are determined to be on field lines. This is determined by thresholding for the colour white, which is handled by the vision pipeline described earlier.

A ray terminates when it touches a line, reaches the edge of the image or reaches the edge of the mirror (as it would be a waste of time to check outside the mirror). Currently we use simple trigonometry to project this ray, although we could use the Bresenham line algorithm for more performance. Rays are stored as only a length in a regular C array, as we can infer the angle between each ray as: 2pi / n_rays This step can be summarised as essentially \u201csampling\u201d the line around us on the field.

The equation to do so is determined by measuring the pixels between points along evenly spaced tape placed on the real field, via Omicontrol.

In our case, we simply apply the dewarp function to each ray length instead, leaving us with each ray essentially in field coordinates (or field lengths) rather than camera coordinates. This dewarping equation is also used by the vision pipeline to determine the distance to the ball and goals in centimetres. Figure 3: example of applying the dewarp function to an entire image, on the low resolution OpenMV H7.

This objective function must be highly optimised as it could be evaluated hundreds of times by the optimisation algorithm.

This is a binary Protcol Buffer file that encodes the geometry of any RoboCup field (including SuperTeam) by dividing it into a grid, where each cell is true if on a line, otherwise false. Increasing the resolution of the grid will increase its accuracy, but also increase its file size. We use a 1cm grid, which stores 44,226 cells and is 42 KiB on disk. This takes about 2 seconds to generate on a fast desktop computer, and is copied across to the LattePanda SBC. The field file is generated by a Python script which can be easily modified to support an arbitrary number of different field layouts, such as SuperTeam or our regional Australian field. Figure 6: visualisation of the field data component of the field file. In the original 243x182 image, 1 pixel = 1cm Although a derivative-based algorithm may be more efficient at solving the problem, we could not determine a way to calculate the derivative of the objective function in a way that was easier than just using a derivative-free algorithm. Especially considering the low dimensionality of the problem, a derivative-based algorithm wasn\u2019t really required. With the robot\u2019s position now determined to the highest accuracy possible, the final step in the localisation process is to smooth and interpolate this coordinate. The optimisation algorithm can produce unstable results, especially in environments where the line is not very visible or mistaken for other objects on the field. Smoothing is currently accomplished by using a simple moving average. A moving median was also tried but led to more unstable results.

With the creation of Omicam, we needed a way of visualising camera output, managing the SBC and editing thresholds. In the past, we used the OpenMV IDE, but given that Omicam is entirely custom developed, this meant we also had to custom-develop our own camera application. In addition, with our new advanced strategies and localisation, as well as the potential auto referee future rule addition, we felt like this year was a good time to add a remote robot management feature with the ability to reposition, reorient and automatically reset robots on the field wirelessly, as well as visualise their positions. We added both of these features into Omicontrol, to make it essentially our all-in-one robot management application. Because the application will be used frequently in debugging as well as in the high-pressure mid-game interval, Omicontrol\u2019s primary design goals are to be easy to use and reliable. Omicontrol is a cross-platform application that works on Windows, Mac and Linux. It\u2019s developed in Kotlin and uses JavaFX for the GUI, via the TornadoFX framework. Figure 1: Omicontrol main window running on KDE neon TODO: maybe make the above a video demonstration fo Omicontrol Views Omicontrol functions through the concepts of \u201cviews\u201d, which provide different information about different aspects of our robot(s). Camera view The Camera View can to view camera output and tune threshold parameters. Field view Similar to teams in the major league, we implement a Field View to display the robots\u2019 localised positions and enable control of them. Calibration view This view is used to calibrate the mirror dewarp model, which translates pixel distances from the centre of the mirror into centimetre distances on the real field. In the past, this was complex and could take upwards of half an hour. We decided this process could be greatly streamlined, so we added the calibration view to Omicontrol. The general flow of generating a mirror model is this process: Lay out a ruler, with clear tape every 5cm Start Omicam and Omicontrol, and open the Calibration View Click on each of the 5cm strips in order to generate data points Select the regression type (exponential or polynomial) Click \u201cCalculate model\u201d Copy the results into the mirrorModel field in Omicam and refresh the config file This approach streamlines mirror model calculation from being a painstaking 30 minute task, into one which can be done in a few button presses in under 5 minutes. TODO talk about auto fill in data thing when you click Model calculation process Once the user has selected a set of points, and the pixel and corresponding centimetre distances have been determined, we now have an interesting problem to solve. Essentially, we have to interpolate this dataset so that for any pixel distance we have, we can generate a corresponding centimetre distance. Ideally, this interpolation method would be accurate for data points that were not observed in the dataset as well (for example, they\u2019re larger than the largest sampled point distance). This means there\u2019s two categories of algorithms we can use: curve fitting and polynomial interpolation. Curve fitting, or a regression, performs a mathematical optimisation routine to optimise the coefficients for an actual function. Polynomial interpolation uses a series of polynomials to interpolate between data points. Examples of polynomial interpolation methods include Lagrange polynomials, Newton polynomials and also spline-based methods like cubic splines. The trouble with polynomial interpolation is that it doesn\u2019t generalise to points outside the sampled dataset, whereas a regression does. Because a regression generates coefficients for a mathematical model, in theory, it can extend with some accuracy outside the dataset, whereas polynomial interpolation just interpolates inside the dataset. Because of this, we decided to use a regression to generate our mirror model. The two models we chose to use for our regression were an N-th order polynomial and an exponential in the form f(x) = ae^(bx) . As both of these models are non-linear, we need to do a non-linear least squares regression to calculate the coefficients. In the polynomial this is N unknowns, and in the exponential it\u2019s just a and b . Traditionally, we used to export the data to Excel and have it calculated in there, but we decided instead to implement the regression ourselves to increase the speed of the mirror calculation process. To perform our least squares regression, we use the Apache Commons Math library and its AbstractCurveFitter . This internally uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, an improvement over the Gauss-Newton algorithm, to converge on the most optimal values for the unknown coefficients. Although Commons Math has a built in PolynomialCurveFitter which can fit a PolynomialFunction , there is no exponential curve fitter or exponential function provided, so we built our own ExponentialCurveFitter and ExpFunction with value and gradient vector. Finally, we also calculate the coefficient of determination (R 2 value) to analyse the accuracy of the model. Commons Math has no built-in way of finding the R 2 value from the result of an AbstractCurveFitter implementation, so instead we implemented it ourselves by calculating the residual sum of squares and total sum of squares as explained here . Wireless connection Being able to connect to any robot wirelessly and manage it can be a great quality of life improvement when debugging fast moving robots. There are a variety of wireless protocols in existence such as Bluetooth Classic, Bluetooth LE, Zigbee and others. However, we decided to use TCP/IP over WiFi because it\u2019s easy to setup and reliable, compared to Bluetooth which has issues on many platforms. To accomplish this, the LattePanda SBC creates a WiFi access point (with no internet connection) that the client computer then connects to, establishing a direct link between the two computers. As shown in Figure 1, the user simply types the local IP to connect and everything else is handled for them. Due to the nature of TCP/IP, we interestingly also have Omicontrol across the Internet. In this setup, an Internet-connected router hosts the LattePanda device on its network via Ethernet or WiFi. The router must port forward port 42708 which is used for Omicam to Omicontrol communications. Then, the client computer in an entirely different location, even a different country, connects to the Omicam router\u2019s public IP address and can interact with the camera and robots as normal. While this is interesting, nonetheless it\u2019s not used in practice due to lack of security, lack of need and Omicam\u2019s high bandwidth requirements (as it\u2019s designed for local connections). Wired connection Although wireless connection is very flexible, on the LattePanda it comes at the cost of a very poor connection in some situations and on some SBCs, unfortunately such as the LattePanda. Thus, we decided to use gigabit Ethernet as an alternative connection type. This also acts as a backup in case the venue bans WiFi hotspots (as has happened before), or there\u2019s too much signal noise to connect properly. This works by using a special Ethernet crossover cable and creating a simple network through assigning static IPs. The user can simply connect to the static IP they assigned the SBC. Just like the WiFi setup, this creates an offline connection between the two devices at a very high bandwidth and stability. We experience no connection issues at all over Ethernet (although there are some occasional issues with SSH). Communication protocol The backbone of bidrectional Omicam to Omicontrol communication is a simple TCP socket on port 42708, with Omicam as the host and Omicontrol as the client. This works both for wireless and wired connections. Communication between the two devices makes heavy use of Protocol Buffers, on the Omicam side via nanopb, and on the Omicontrol end in Kotlin via the official Java API from Google (which also works with Kotlin). One of the benefits of Protocol Buffers is that both Omicam with nanopb and Omicontrol with the Java API share the exact same Protobuf definition file ( RemoteDebug.proto ), they just are the result of different code generators. This means that as long as both the Java and C code is generated at the same time, they are guaranteed to be compatible with each other. Internally, Omicontrol creates a thread to manage the TCP connection in the ConnectionManager class which handles encoding and transmitting Protocol Buffer data over the socket, as well as detecting errors in the connection. All of the code that awaits a response from the remote runs in a separate thread to the JavaFX UI thread so that the UI isn\u2019t locked up every time a response is queued. When a button in Omicontrol is clicked, this thread encodes and transmits a Protocol Buffer message to Omicam and waits for a response asynchronously, notifying the calling thread once one is received. Should put more info here, stuff like how we basically have budget RPC with protobuf Design considerations The Omicontrol UI was designed to look professional, be simple to use, friendly to use as a tablet and work cross-platform. Since Omicontrol is written in Kotlin using JavaFX (via TornadoFX), the app runs on Windows, Mac and Linux with minimal porting required (mainly for changing display types).","title":"Omicontrol"},{"location":"omicontrol/#views","text":"Omicontrol functions through the concepts of \u201cviews\u201d, which provide different information about different aspects of our robot(s).","title":"Views"},{"location":"omicontrol/#camera-view","text":"The Camera View can to view camera output and tune threshold parameters.","title":"Camera view"},{"location":"omicontrol/#field-view","text":"Similar to teams in the major league, we implement a Field View to display the robots\u2019 localised positions and enable control of them.","title":"Field view"},{"location":"omicontrol/#calibration-view","text":"This view is used to calibrate the mirror dewarp model, which translates pixel distances from the centre of the mirror into centimetre distances on the real field.

In the past, we had looked into using a SBC for entire robot control, but we decided that this would be too complicated. Using an embedded system (microcontroller) and RTOS was a better, more reliable solution. Instead, we focused effort on finding an SBC that would power our vision pipeline. It would need to achieve excellent performance, while not being too expensive. Hardware Our custom camera software (Omicam) supports any computer that runs x86 Linux (however, it has only been tested on Ubuntu). Currently, Team Omicron uses a LattePanda Delta 432 with a 2.4 GHz quad-core Intel Celeron N4100, 4GB RAM, 32GB of storage, WiFi, Bluetooth, gigabit Ethernet and a UART bus. The current camera we use is an e-con Systems Hyperyon , using the Sony Starvis IMX290 ultra low-light sensor capable of seeing in almost pitch black at high framerates. This is a USB 2.0 camera module, since the LattePanda has no MIPI port. SBC iterations The current iteration of Omicam\u2019s SBC setup is the cumulation of around 2 years of prototyping iterations in both hardware and software approaches. Prototype 1 (December 2018-January 2019): This consisted of a Raspberry Pi Zero W, with a 1 GHz single-core CPU. It was our initial prototype for a single-board computer, however, we quickly found it was far too weak to do any vision, and our inexperience at the time didn\u2019t help. Thus, we canned the SBC project for around a year. Prototype 2 (December 2019): After resurrecting the SBC R&D project for our 2020 Internationals, we started development with the Raspberry Pi 4. This has a 1.5 GHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 CPU. We began developing a custom computer vision library tailored specifically to our task, using the Pi\u2019s MMAL API for GPU-accelerated camera decoding. Initial results showed we could threshold images successfully, but we believed it would be too slow to localise and run a connected-component labeller in real time. Prototype 3 (January 2020): Next, we moved onto the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, containing a 1.43 GHz quad-core Cortex-A57, but far more importantly a 128-core Maxwell GPU. At this time we also switched to using OpenCV 4 for our computer vision. In theory, using the GPU for processing would lead to a huge performance boost due to the parallelism, however, in practice we observed the GPU was significantly slower than even the weaker Cortex-A43 CPU, (presumably) due to copying times. We were unable to optimise this to standard after weeks of development, thus we decided to move on from this prototype. Prototype 4 (January-February 2020): After much research, we decided to use the LattePanda Delta 432. The OpenCV pipeline is now entirely CPU bound, and despite not using the GPU at all, we are able to achieve good performance. Camera module iterations In addition to the SBC, the camera module has undergone many iterations, as it\u2019s also an important element in the vision pipeline. Pi Camera: The initial camera we used in hardware prototypes 1-3, was the Raspberry Pi Camera. In prototype 1, we used the Pi Cam v1.3 which is an OV5647 connected via MIPI, and in prototypes 2 and 3 we used the Pi Cam v2 which is an IMX219 again connected via MIPI. We had to drop this camera in later iterations because the LattePanda doesn\u2019t have a MIPI port. Both of these cameras were capable of around 720p at 60 fps. OV4689-based module: We experimented with a generic OV4689 USB 2.0 camera module from Amazon, which is capable of streaming JPEGs (aka an MJPEG stream) at 720p at 120 fps (we could get around 90 fps in practice with no processing). While this framerate was useful, the camera module suffered from noise and flickering in relatively good lighting conditions, so it was dropped. e-con Hyperyon: After these two failures, we began looking into industrial-grade cameras to use on our robot. While most of these, from companies like FLIR, are out of our price range, we found e-con Systems as a relatively affordable vendor of high quality cameras. We narrowed down our selection to two devices: the See3CAM_CU30 USB 2/USB 3 2MP camera module, which is fairly standard and affordable, as well as the more expensive Hyperyon described above. After testing both, we decided the Hyperon fit our needs better, despite its higher latency, due to its extremely good low light performance.","title":"SBC"},{"location":"sbc/#sbc","text":"","title":"SBC"},{"location":"sbc/#introduction","text":"This year, we investigated using a single board computer (SBC) for our robot\u2019s vision system.

We also aimed on improving hardware from previous years including the custom omni-directional wheels introduced last year. The following are the major hardware improvements that have occurred this year: Custom omni-directional wheels Custom kicker unit Custom microcontroller circuits Custom camera hardware Mouse sensor implemenation Various debugging options for software to use Design Overview TODO: PUT PICTURE OF DESIGN HERE, POSSIBLE EXPLODED VIEW OR A360 LINK Omni-directional Wheels Omni-directional wheels (also referred to as omniwheels ) are specially designed to give robots full freedom of motion, enabling them to travel in any direction without turning. The downside to these wheels is the relative lack of tracktion and robustness when compared to conventional tires due to the individual rollers. As such, the primary goal of new iterations is to increase the grip and distance of the wheels. The following image shows the development of the omniwheel used throughout the years of competition with the rightmost being the latest design: TODO: PUT PICTURE HERE Past Iterations The two leftmost designs, the Kornylak and GTF omniwheel are stock designs bought pre-made from the manufacturer. Through using both these wheels for a year, we discovered that they were lacking in grip and robustness respectively, leading us to develop our own designs. The third design was our first attempt at a custom omniwheel, featuring double layered rollers and individual roller axles for faster repair. Though it allowed for much smoother movement and better traction, the wheels were large and unwieldly and the rollers still broke due to the use of softer silicon rollers. Furthermore, the use of 3D printed components caused rollers to fall out of the wheel during games. TODO: PUT PICTURES OF NATOINALS WHEEL, DOUBLE WHEEL WITH SMALL ROLLERS AND BIG WHEEL WITH SMALL ROLLERS Development of current wheel The leftmost design was a revised version of your first custom omniwheel. Various different materials were lasercut in order to replace the 3D printed components. After extensive testing, it was decided that PVC was to be used as it was durable, cheap and easy to laser cut. Alternatives materials included acrylic, which was not strong enough, and aluminium, which was too expensive to manufacture. The middle design is our second attempt at a custom omniwheel, once again featuring double layered rollers. However, this time smaller diameter rollers were used to allow the wheel to be much more compact. Consequently, this permitted the use of wheel protection guards, as seen in the image below. This prevented the wheels from getting damaged, often a result of the wheels grinding up against other robots or objects. In addition, the individual roller axels were replaced with metal wire to prevent the rollers from falling out. The rightmost design is a modified version of the middle design. Instead of having lots of smaller rollers, fewer longer rollers are used instead. This makes the wheel much easier to take apart and the rollers less likely to break.

The downside to these wheels is the relative lack of tracktion and robustness when compared to conventional tires due to the individual rollers. As such, the primary goal of new iterations is to increase the grip and distance of the wheels. The following image shows the development of the omniwheel used throughout the years of competition with the rightmost being the latest design: TODO: PUT PICTURE HERE","title":"Omni-directional Wheels"},{"location":"structural_design/#past-iterations","text":"The two leftmost designs, the Kornylak and GTF omniwheel are stock designs bought pre-made from the manufacturer. Through using both these wheels for a year, we discovered that they were lacking in grip and robustness respectively, leading us to develop our own designs. The third design was our first attempt at a custom omniwheel, featuring double layered rollers and individual roller axles for faster repair. Though it allowed for much smoother movement and better traction, the wheels were large and unwieldly and the rollers still broke due to the use of softer silicon rollers. Furthermore, the use of 3D printed components caused rollers to fall out of the wheel during games.

Various different materials were lasercut in order to replace the 3D printed components. After extensive testing, it was decided that PVC was to be used as it was durable, cheap and easy to laser cut. Alternatives materials included acrylic, which was not strong enough, and aluminium, which was too expensive to manufacture. The middle design is our second attempt at a custom omniwheel, once again featuring double layered rollers. However, this time smaller diameter rollers were used to allow the wheel to be much more compact. Consequently, this permitted the use of wheel protection guards, as seen in the image below. This prevented the wheels from getting damaged, often a result of the wheels grinding up against other robots or objects. In addition, the individual roller axels were replaced with metal wire to prevent the rollers from falling out. The rightmost design is a modified version of the middle design. Instead of having lots of smaller rollers, fewer longer rollers are used instead. This makes the wheel much easier to take apart and the rollers less likely to break.
