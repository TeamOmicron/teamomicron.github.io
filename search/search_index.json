The application is developed mostly in C, with some C++ code to interface with OpenCV. It runs on the powerful LattePanda Delta 432 single board computer and uses Linux (Xubuntu 18.04) as its OS. We are proud to report that Omicam is a significant step up compared to previous vision applications in use at BBC Robotics, as explained in the \u201cPerformance and results\u201d section. Omicam consists of X lines of code, and took about X hours to develop. Background and previous methods Intelligent, accurate and fast computer vision continues to become increasingly important in RoboCup Jr Open Soccer. With the introduction of the orange ball and advanced teams\u2019 application of \u201cball-hiding\u201d strategies, high resolution yet performant computer vision is now one of the most important elements of a successful RoboCup Jr Open robot. However, detecting the field objects (ball, goals, etc) is now only the bare minimum. Advanced teams also need to accurately estimate their position on the field (localise) in order to execute advanced strategies and gain the upper hand in the competition. Previously, our team used an OpenMV H7 to provide vision. This is a module which uses an STM32 MCU combined combined with an OmniVision camera module to provide low-resolution vision in an easy-to-use MicroPython environment. However, although this approach is functional, its resolution and framerate are extremely limiting for our use case. Hence, we decided the best solution was to do what the most advanced teams were doing, and develop a custom vision application running on a single board computer (SBC). In terms of localisation, in the past we managed to get away with not using any, or using a low-fidelity approach based on detecting the goals in the image. Performance and results Omicam is capable of detecting 4 field objects at 60-70fps at 720p (1280x720) resolution . Compared to the previous OpenMV H7, this is 23x higher resolution at 3x the framerate. 1 In addition, using the novel vision-based localisation algorithm we developed this year, we can now determine the robot\u2019s position to <1cm accuracy at realtime speeds. This is over 5x/25x more accurate 2 than any previous methods used at BBC Robotics, and has been shown to be much more reliable and stable. To achieve this performance, we made heavy use of parallel programming techniques, OpenCV\u2019s x86 SIMD CPU optimisations, Clang optimiser flags as well as intelligent image downscaling for the goal threshold images (as they are mostly unused). In addition, the localisation, vision and remote debug pipelines all run in parallel to each other so the entire application is asynchronous. 1 previous results based on mediocre lighting conditions running well optimised OpenMV H7 code at QVGA resolution. 2 depending on whether LRF based/goal based localisation was used. Hardware Omicam runs on a Linux-based LattePanda Delta 432. It uses an OV4689 USB 2.0 camera module, which is capable of streaming motion JPEG (MJPEG) at 720p 100+ fps. More here, justifcations for why we picked this hardware. TODO cover Omicam development with other SBCs Field object detection The primary responsibility of Omicam is to detect the bounding box and centroid of field objects: the ball, goals and also lines. To do this, we use the popular computer vision library OpenCV (v4.2.0). We use Video4Linux2 (V4L2) to acquire an MJPEG stream from the USB camera, via the popular gstreamer library. Then, we apply any pre-processing steps such as downscaling the goal frames and gamma boosting. Next, we threshold all objects in parallel to make use of our quad-core CPU, using OpenCV\u2019s inRange thresholder but a custom parallel framework (as it doesn\u2019t run in parallel by default). Thresholding generates a 1-bit binary mask of the image, where each pixel is 255 (true) if it\u2019s inside the RGB range specified, and 0 (false) if it\u2019s not. Then, we use OpenCV\u2019s parallel connected component labeller, specifically the algorithm by Grana et al. 1 to detect regions of the same colour in the image. The largest connected region will be the field object we are looking for. OpenCV automatically calculates the bounding box and centroid for each of these connected regions. We then dispatch the largest detected blob\u2019s centroid via UART to the ESP32, encoded using Protocol Buffers and using POSIX termios for UART configuration. TODO images and/or video of thresholded field Localisation Previous methods and background Localisation is the problem of detecting where the robot is on the field. This information is essential to know in order to develop advanced strategies and precise movement control, instead of just driving directly towards the ball. Currently, teams use three main ways of localisation. Firstly, the simplest approach uses the detected goals in the camera to estimate the robot\u2019s position. This approach is very inaccurate because of the low resolution of most cameras (such as the OpenMV), the fact that there are only two goals to work with as well as the fact that sometimes the goals are not visible (especially in super team). Expected accuracy is 15-25cm. The second approach in use is based on distance sensors such laser range finders (LRFs) or ultrasonic sensors. By using several of these sensors on a robot, the position of the robot can be inferred with trigonometry, by measuring the distance to the walls. This approach has a major drawback: it is impossible to reliably distinguish between anomalous objects, such as a hand or another robot, compared to a wall. This means that although this approach is somewhat accurate on an empty field, it is very difficult to use reliably in actual games. Thus, localisation data was almost never trusted by teams who used this approach and so is not very helpful. In addition, distances sensors, especially ultrasonics, are slow and suffer from inaccuracy at long distances. Expected accuracy is 5-10cm, but data is invalidated every time a robot moves in the way of a sensor, which is impossible to know. The third approach in use by some teams is one based on 360 degree LiDARS. These are expensive, heavy, difficult to use, slow and are still vulnerable to all the problems the second approach suffers from as well. We are not aware of expected accuracy, but regard this as not an ideal approach. Our solution This year, Team Omicron presents a novel approach to robot localisation based partly on a middle-size league paper by Lu, Li, Zhang, Hu & Zheng 2 . We localise using only RGB camera data by solving a multi-variate non-linear optimisation problem in realtime, making inferences from the position of the lines on the game field. The principle method of operation of our algorithm is that we need to match a virtual model of field geometry to the observed one from the camera, thereby inferring our position. Another way to think of it is we need to generate a transform such that a virtual model of the field will align with the real one, thereby also calculating our 2D position. If we match the lines so that they align in both the virtual model and real-world model, then we can infer that the calculated virtual robot coordinates are the same as the real, unknown robot coordinates. Essentially, we\u2019re taking what we know: the static layout of the field, and observed field geometry at our current position, and using it to infer the unknown 2D position vector. This is a form of the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which can be solved through a multitude of approaches such as iterative closest point (commonly used with 3D LiDARS), Monte-Carlo localisation via a particle filter or gradient fields. However, most of these approaches also consider rotation as a factor. Due to to our use of a high-accuracy BNO-055 IMU, we consider rotation to be a non-issue that can be easily corrected for, thereby reducing the complexity of the problem. Thus, we developed a novel three step algorithm involving ray-casting to infer our 2D position, ignoring rotation as a factor to be solved for. These steps are: Image analysis Camera normalisation Coordinate optimisation Image analysis The localiser\u2019s input is a 1-bit mask of pixels that are determined to be on field lines. This is determined by thresholding for the colour white, which is handled by the vision pipeline described earlier. With the input provided, a certain number of rays (usually 128) are emitted from the centre of the line image. A ray terminates when it touches a line, reaches the edge of the image or reaches the edge of the mirror (as it would be a waste of time to check outside the mirror). The theory of operation behind this is, essentially, for each field position each ray should have its own unique distance. Rays are stored as only a length in a regular C array, as we can infer the angle between each ray as: 2pi / n_rays Figure 1: example of ray casting on field, with a position near to the centre Camera normalisation These rays are then dewarped to counter the distortion of the 360 degree mirror. The equation to do so is determined by measuring the pixels between points along evenly spaced tape placed on the real field, via Omicontrol. Using regression software such as Excel or Desmos, an equation can then be calculated to map pixel distances to real distances. Below we demonstrate the result of dewarping an entire image (using the output of the OpenMV H7), which we deemed too inefficient to run in realtime. In our case, we simply apply the dewarp function to each ray length instead. This dewarping equation is also used by the vision pipeline to determine the distance to the ball and goals in centimetres. Figure 2: example of frame dewarping from the old, low reolution OpenMV H7 The second phase of the camera normalisation is to rotate the rays relative to the robot\u2019s heading, using a rotation matrix. The robot\u2019s heading value, which is relative to when it was powered on, is transmitted by the ESP32, again using Protocol Buffers. For information about how this value is calculated using the IMU, see the ESP32 and movement code page. TODO: explanation on why this is done Position optimisation The main part of our solution is the Subplex local derivative-free non-linear optimiser 3 , re-implemented as part of the NLopt package 4 . This algorithm essentially acts as an efficiency and stability improvement over the well-known Nelder-Mead Simplex algorithm. The most critical part of this process is the objective function , which is a function that takes an N-dimensional vector (in our case, an estimated 2D position) and calculates essentially a \u201cscore\u201d of how accurate the value is. This objective function must be highly optimised as it could be evaluated hundreds of times by the optimisation algorithm. Figure 3: map of objective function for a robot placed at the centre of the field. White pixels indicate high accuracy areas and black pixels indicate less accurate areas. A naive approach, where every grid cell is evaluated and the lowest value is picked, would require 44,226 objective function evaluation which takes about 5 seconds on a fast computer. Using the Subplex optimiser, this can be reduced to just 62 evaluations for a 1.2mm accurate fix. TODO: cover approaches we drafted: line points, etc. Also, use more images in the docs We spent a great deal of effort drafting the most efficient objective function, and the approach we present makes heavy use of pre-computation via a \u201cfield file\u201d. This field file is a binary Protcol Buffer file that encodes the geometry of any RoboCup field by dividing it into a grid, where each cell is true if on a line, otherwise false. Increasing the resolution of the grid will increase its accuracy, but also significantly increase its file size. We use a 1cm grid, which stores 44,226 cells and is 42 KiB on disk. This takes about 2 seconds to generate on a fast desktop computer, and is copied across to the LattePanda. The field file is generated by a Python script which can be easily modified to support an arbitrary number of different field layouts, such as SuperTeam or our regional Australian field. Although the field file could theoretically be loaded via the bitmap image below, images are more difficult to load than Protobuf files and it would not support grid cell sizes smaller or larger than 1cm. Figure 3: bitmap image displaying generated field file. In the original 243x182 image, 1 pixel = 1cm The objective function essentially compares the difference between the ray lengths, as follows: Consider the estimated position (eX, eY). Move to (eX, eY) in the field file and raycast out to generate the array expectedRays . For each ray in the dewarped observedRays from the camera (which are now in field units, same as expectedRays ), do the following: totalError += abs(expectedRays[i] - observedRays[i]) Although a derivative-based algorithm may be more efficient at solving the problem, we deemed it far too difficult to calculate the derivative of the objective function. Adding new sensor data to the world model Our localisation algorithm is also flexible with new sensor inputs. Due to the use of a \u201cvirtual world model\u201d approach, if any sensors can be modelled as a measurement of a distance to a static object, then they can be integrated as extra data in the world model. This is extremely helpful when vision data runs into limitations, for example, in SuperTeam where it may be difficult to see enough field lines in one frame due to the size of the field. We integrate the LRFs on the robot as extra distance sensors, using their reported distance to the field walls just as we use the raycasted \u201cline points\u201d in the vision based approach. It would also be possible to use the distance to the goals as virtual information to supplement a potential lack of line data and thus increase accuracy. Other distance sensors such as 360 LiDARS can also be implemented with ease. Interfacing with Omicontrol To interface with our remote management application Omicontrol, Omicam starts a TCP server on port 42708. This server sends Protocol Buffer packets containing JPEG encoded frames, zlib compressed threshold data as well as other information such as the temperature of the SBC. Although C isn\u2019t an officially supported language by Google for Protocol Buffers, we use the mature nanopb library to do the encoding. This is the same library used on the ESP32 and Teensy as well, and so far we\u2019ve had no issues with it. We use the SIMD optimised libjpeg-turbo to efficiently encode JPEG frames, so as to not waste performance to the remote debugger (which is disabled during competition). Instead of compressing threshold frames with JPEG, because they are 1-bit images, it was determined that zlib could compress them more efficiently (around about 460,800x reduction in size). With all these optimisations, even at high framerates (60+ packets per second), the remote debug system uses no more than 1 MB/s of outgoing bandwidth, which is small enough to work reliably on both local and Internet networks. Debugging and performance optimisation Low-level compiled languages such as C and C++ are notoriously unstable and difficult to debug. In order to improve the stability of Omicam and fix bugs, we used Google\u2019s Address Sanitizer to easily find and trace a variety of bugs such as buffer overflows, memory leaks and more. In addition, we used the LLVM toolchain\u2019s debugger lldb (or just gdb) to analyse the application frequently. To assist in performance evaluation, we used the Linux tool OProfile to determine the slowest method calls in the application. Although the Clang compiler may have marginally worse performance than GCC, we chose Clang because it\u2019s more modern and has better debugging support (namely, GCC\u2019s Adress Sanitizer implementation is broken for us). To improve performance of the localiser, we use the last extrapolated position from the mouse sensor as a seed for the initial position of the next search. This means instead of starting from a random position, the localiser will complete much quickly a it\u2019s already relatively close to the true position.

This is determined by thresholding for the colour white, which is handled by the vision pipeline described earlier. With the input provided, a certain number of rays (usually 128) are emitted from the centre of the line image. A ray terminates when it touches a line, reaches the edge of the image or reaches the edge of the mirror (as it would be a waste of time to check outside the mirror). The theory of operation behind this is, essentially, for each field position each ray should have its own unique distance. Rays are stored as only a length in a regular C array, as we can infer the angle between each ray as: 2pi / n_rays Figure 1: example of ray casting on field, with a position near to the centre","title":"Image analysis"},{"location":"omicam/#camera-normalisation","text":"These rays are then dewarped to counter the distortion of the 360 degree mirror. The equation to do so is determined by measuring the pixels between points along evenly spaced tape placed on the real field, via Omicontrol. Using regression software such as Excel or Desmos, an equation can then be calculated to map pixel distances to real distances. Below we demonstrate the result of dewarping an entire image (using the output of the OpenMV H7), which we deemed too inefficient to run in realtime. In our case, we simply apply the dewarp function to each ray length instead. This dewarping equation is also used by the vision pipeline to determine the distance to the ball and goals in centimetres. Figure 2: example of frame dewarping from the old, low reolution OpenMV H7 The second phase of the camera normalisation is to rotate the rays relative to the robot\u2019s heading, using a rotation matrix. The robot\u2019s heading value, which is relative to when it was powered on, is transmitted by the ESP32, again using Protocol Buffers. For information about how this value is calculated using the IMU, see the ESP32 and movement code page. TODO: explanation on why this is done","title":"Camera normalisation"},{"location":"omicam/#position-optimisation","text":"The main part of our solution is the Subplex local derivative-free non-linear optimiser 3 , re-implemented as part of the NLopt package 4 . This algorithm essentially acts as an efficiency and stability improvement over the well-known Nelder-Mead Simplex algorithm. The most critical part of this process is the objective function , which is a function that takes an N-dimensional vector (in our case, an estimated 2D position) and calculates essentially a \u201cscore\u201d of how accurate the value is. This objective function must be highly optimised as it could be evaluated hundreds of times by the optimisation algorithm. Figure 3: map of objective function for a robot placed at the centre of the field. White pixels indicate high accuracy areas and black pixels indicate less accurate areas. A naive approach, where every grid cell is evaluated and the lowest value is picked, would require 44,226 objective function evaluation which takes about 5 seconds on a fast computer. Using the Subplex optimiser, this can be reduced to just 62 evaluations for a 1.2mm accurate fix. TODO: cover approaches we drafted: line points, etc. Also, use more images in the docs We spent a great deal of effort drafting the most efficient objective function, and the approach we present makes heavy use of pre-computation via a \u201cfield file\u201d. This field file is a binary Protcol Buffer file that encodes the geometry of any RoboCup field by dividing it into a grid, where each cell is true if on a line, otherwise false. Increasing the resolution of the grid will increase its accuracy, but also significantly increase its file size. We use a 1cm grid, which stores 44,226 cells and is 42 KiB on disk. This takes about 2 seconds to generate on a fast desktop computer, and is copied across to the LattePanda. The field file is generated by a Python script which can be easily modified to support an arbitrary number of different field layouts, such as SuperTeam or our regional Australian field. Although the field file could theoretically be loaded via the bitmap image below, images are more difficult to load than Protobuf files and it would not support grid cell sizes smaller or larger than 1cm. Figure 3: bitmap image displaying generated field file. In the original 243x182 image, 1 pixel = 1cm The objective function essentially compares the difference between the ray lengths, as follows: Consider the estimated position (eX, eY). Move to (eX, eY) in the field file and raycast out to generate the array expectedRays . For each ray in the dewarped observedRays from the camera (which are now in field units, same as expectedRays ), do the following: totalError += abs(expectedRays[i] - observedRays[i]) Although a derivative-based algorithm may be more efficient at solving the problem, we deemed it far too difficult to calculate the derivative of the objective function.","title":"Position optimisation"},{"location":"omicam/#adding-new-sensor-data-to-the-world-model","text":"Our localisation algorithm is also flexible with new sensor inputs. Due to the use of a \u201cvirtual world model\u201d approach, if any sensors can be modelled as a measurement of a distance to a static object, then they can be integrated as extra data in the world model. This is extremely helpful when vision data runs into limitations, for example, in SuperTeam where it may be difficult to see enough field lines in one frame due to the size of the field. We integrate the LRFs on the robot as extra distance sensors, using their reported distance to the field walls just as we use the raycasted \u201cline points\u201d in the vision based approach. It would also be possible to use the distance to the goals as virtual information to supplement a potential lack of line data and thus increase accuracy. Other distance sensors such as 360 LiDARS can also be implemented with ease.","title":"Adding new sensor data to the world model"},{"location":"omicam/#interfacing-with-omicontrol","text":"To interface with our remote management application Omicontrol, Omicam starts a TCP server on port 42708. This server sends Protocol Buffer packets containing JPEG encoded frames, zlib compressed threshold data as well as other information such as the temperature of the SBC. Although C isn\u2019t an officially supported language by Google for Protocol Buffers, we use the mature nanopb library to do the encoding. This is the same library used on the ESP32 and Teensy as well, and so far we\u2019ve had no issues with it. We use the SIMD optimised libjpeg-turbo to efficiently encode JPEG frames, so as to not waste performance to the remote debugger (which is disabled during competition). Instead of compressing threshold frames with JPEG, because they are 1-bit images, it was determined that zlib could compress them more efficiently (around about 460,800x reduction in size). With all these optimisations, even at high framerates (60+ packets per second), the remote debug system uses no more than 1 MB/s of outgoing bandwidth, which is small enough to work reliably on both local and Internet networks.","title":"Interfacing with Omicontrol"},{"location":"omicam/#debugging-and-performance-optimisation","text":"Low-level compiled languages such as C and C++ are notoriously unstable and difficult to debug. In order to improve the stability of Omicam and fix bugs, we used Google\u2019s Address Sanitizer to easily find and trace a variety of bugs such as buffer overflows, memory leaks and more. In addition, we used the LLVM toolchain\u2019s debugger lldb (or just gdb) to analyse the application frequently. To assist in performance evaluation, we used the Linux tool OProfile to determine the slowest method calls in the application. Although the Clang compiler may have marginally worse performance than GCC, we chose Clang because it\u2019s more modern and has better debugging support (namely, GCC\u2019s Adress Sanitizer implementation is broken for us). To improve performance of the localiser, we use the last extrapolated position from the mouse sensor as a seed for the initial position of the next search.
